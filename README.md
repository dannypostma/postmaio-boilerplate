## Postma.io Boilerplate

This is the template I used for postma.io and for most of my other projects.

- /app contains the frontend build with Nuxt2, deployed to Vercel.com
- /server contains the server build with NodeJS/Express, deployed to Render.com


**Make sure to fill in the .env variables and change the file name to .env.**

This is a freeby and I won't give support to set everything up. Enjoy!
